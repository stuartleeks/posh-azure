Issues
* Package as a module
* Filter the cmdlets better (focus on AzureRm*)
* set up publishing to posh-gallery
* decide how to handle expiry. Want to pick up new names (e.g. resourcegroupname after new RG created). What happens when active subscription is switched?
* incorporate Azure status cmdlet
